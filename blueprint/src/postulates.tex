\chapter{Postulates}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{post:1} Let it have been postulated to draw a straight-line from any point to any point.
    \item \label{post:2} And to produce a finite straight-line continuously in a straight-line.
    \item \label{post:3} And to draw a circle with any center and radius.
    \item \label{post:4} And that all right-angles are equal to one another.
    \item \label{post:5} And that if a straight-line falling across two (other) straight-lines makes internal angles on the same side (of itself whose sum is) less than two right-angles, then the two (other) straight-lines, being produced to infinity, meet on that side (of the original straight-line) that the (sum of the internal angles) is less than two right-angles (and do not meet on the other side).
\end{enumerate}
