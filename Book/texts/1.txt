To construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight-line. Let $AB$ be the given finite straight-line.  <prf> Thus, the three (straight-lines) $CA$, $AB$, and $BC$ are equal to one another.Thus, the triangle $ABC$ is equilateral, and has been constructed on the given finite straight-line $AB$.
