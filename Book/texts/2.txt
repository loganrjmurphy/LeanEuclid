To place a straight-line equal to a given straight-line at a given point (as an extremity). Let $A$ be the given point, and $BC$ the given straight-line.  <prf>  Thus, $AL$ is also equal to $BC$. Thus, the straight-line $AL$, equal to the given straight-line $BC$, has been placed at the given point $A$.
