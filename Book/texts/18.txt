In any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle. For let $ABC$ be a triangle having side $AC$ greater than $AB$. I say that angle $ABC$ is also greater than $BCA$.   <prf>  Thus, $ABC$ is much greater than  $ACB$.  Thus, in any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle. (Which is) the very thing  it was required to show.
