Parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another. Let $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ be parallelograms which are on the equal bases $BC$ and $FG$, and (are) between the same parallels $AH$ and $BG$. I say that the parallelogram $ABCD$ is equal to $EFGH$. <prf> So that the parallelogram $ABCD$ is  also equal to $EFGH$.Thus, parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another.
