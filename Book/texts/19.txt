In any triangle, the greater angle is subtended by the greater side. Let $ABC$ be a triangle having the angle $ABC$ greater than $BCA$. I say that side $AC$ is also greater than side $AB$. <prf>  Thus, $AC$  is greater than $AB$. Thus, in any triangle, the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.
